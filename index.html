        Hands-on, tech-savy, fast-leaner, double-bachelors in computer science & electrical engineering from the University of Windsor in Canada. 
        Currently seeking new opportunities within the field of full-stack web-development & software engineering. I have information technology experience 
        in the banking and automotive industry. In university, while pursuing Electrical Engineering, I have worked with VHDL, C++, Matlab; while pursuing Computer
        Science, I primarily worked with with object-oriented languages such as C programming with Raptor, Java, bash-scripting on linux; full-stack web-development 
        languages such as HTML5, PHP, JavaScript; database languages suchas MySQL, which I also use as a bank-end language that I can for front-end data storage. My 
        goal is to be successful in the IT field by starting off in the full-stack web-development field and eventually after a couple of years gaining IT experience,
        I may move towards the direction of either machine learning or artificial intelligence, dealing with robotics. Outside of technology, I have interests in 
        travelling, canoeing, soccer, drawing, calligraphy, lifting weights, modifying cars and bikes. I have lived most of my life in North America, both in Canada 
        and United States, but I have also lived in South Asia and Middle East, making me a multi-cultural individual. Other than being passionate about the Software 
        field as a career and hobby, I like the fact that it has the flexibility of working both on-site and remotely, as well as opportunities being global.
